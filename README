Statismo is a C++ library for generating and manipulating Statistical
Shape and Image Models. It supports all commonly known types of
statistical models, including Shape models, Deformation Models and
Appearance Models. The implementation and interpretation is based on
Probabilistic PCA, which generalizes the standard PCA models and gives
a fully probabilistic interpretation.
