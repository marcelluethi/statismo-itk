Statismo is a C++ library for generating and manipulating Statistical
Shape and Image Models. It supports all commonly known types of
statistical models, including Shape models, Deformation Models and
Appearance Models. The implementation and interpretation is based on
Probabilistic PCA, which generalizes the standard PCA models and gives
a fully probabilistic interpretation.

How to build Statismo: 
----------------------
Statismo is a header only library. You simply
include the necessary header files into your C++ program and statismo
will be compiled together with your program.  Have a look at the
examples to see how to compile a typical application. 

To use Statsmo from Python, call CMake with the path to 
Wrappings/SWIG (for the VTK Wrappings) and Wrappings/ITK (for the ITK Wrappings).
See the WIKI (github.com/statismo/statismo/wiki) for more information.
