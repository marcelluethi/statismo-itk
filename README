Statismo is a C++ library for generating and manipulating Statistical
Shape and Image Models. It supports all commonly known types of
statistical models, including Shape models, Deformation Models and
Appearance Models. The implementation and interpretation is based on
Probabilistic PCA, which generalizes the standard PCA models and gives
a fully probabilistic interpretation.

How to build Statismo: 
----------------------
Statismo is a header only library. There is no need to compile statismo. You simply include the necessary 
header files into your application and statismo is compiled together with  your application. 
However, statismo depends on some third-party libraries (such as HDF5) and to use it from your applications, 
you need to correctly specify all the path to the different include directories and libraries. 

To simplify this process, we have provided a CMake file that takes care of this process. 

To install statismo use the usual CMake workflow (here demonstrated for linux):
1) Create a directory that  holds your binary data and change into that directory
> mkdir build_dir
> cd build_dir
2) Configure the project. 
> ccmake path_to_statismo
Make sure that you set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the path where you want to install statismo 
3) Compile and install statismo
> make 
> make install

This builds the dependencies and copies the necessary files to the installation directory. 
In particular, it generates the file statismo-config.cmake, that holds the correct configuration. 
To use statismo from your application, you can now simply include the command
FindPackage(statismo) into your CMakeLists.txt file. This will set up the CMake variables 
- STATISMO_DIR 
- STATISMO_LIBRARIES 
- STATISMO_INCLUDE_DIR 
- STATISMO_LIBRARY_DIR

See the examples (in the Example folder) to see how statismo is used. 
To build the examples, simply run CMake with the respective example folder.

Statismo also comes with Python Wrappings that lets you use statismo from Python, together with the Python wrappings for VTK and ITK. 
To build the wrappings, run CMake in the folder ./Wrapping/Swig and ./Wrapping/ITK  and set your PYTHONPATH to the respective directory.
