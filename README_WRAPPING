The wrappers are built using ITK's Wrapping mechanism (WrapITK).
In order for the build to work, one needs to build against a build (and not installed version) of ITK.
Furthermore, one needs to manually link the Typedef directory from the ITK build into the own build tree. 
The build sometimes stops with an error. Calling make again will make it proceed.
