C++ example programs that illustrate the basic functionality of statismo. 
The examples illustrate the use of Statismo together with VTK and ITK: 

Compiling the examples:
-----------------------
The examples can be built using CMake:
cd YOUR_BUILD_DIR
ccmake STATISMO_DIR/Examples/VTK
or 
ccmake STATISMO_DIR/Examples/ITK

In the configuration you will have to specify the path to 
Statismo, and the path to your installation of the HDF5 library
(http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/). 

Depending on which examples you build, you will also have to have VTK (www.vtk.org) or ITK (www.itk.org) installed. 

Running the examples
--------------------
Once you have compiled the examples, you can run them on the example data
provided in the STATISMO_DIR/data folder.
