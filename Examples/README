C++ example programs that illustrate the basic functionality of statismo. 
The examples illustrate the use of Statismo together with VTK and ITK: 

Compiling the examples:
-----------------------
The examples can be built using CMake by setting the BUILD_{ITK,VTK} options in your build tree.
The executables are then placed into the "bin" subdirectory in your build tree.

Depending on which examples you build, you will also have to have VTK (www.vtk.org) or ITK (www.itk.org) installed. 

Running the examples
--------------------
Once you have compiled the examples, you can run them on the example data
provided in the STATISMO_DIR/data folder.
