C++ example programs that illustrate the basic functionality of Statismo. 
The examples illustrate the use of Statismo together with VTK and ITK: 

Compiling the examples:
-----------------------
The examples can be built using CMake by setting the BUILD_{ITK,VTK} options in your build tree.
The executables are then placed into the "bin" subdirectory in your build tree.

Depending on which examples you build, you will also have to have VTK (www.vtk.org) or ITK (www.itk.org) installed. 

Running the examples
--------------------
Once you have compiled the examples, you can run them on the example data
provided in the STATISMO_DIR/data folder.

Visualization of the results
----------------------------
To view the results (samples drawn from the model) we suggest the use of paraview, which is available at
www.paraview.org. 
The HDF5 file, which stores the model information, can for example be viewed using hdfview (http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/)

Building models of more interesting structures
----------------------------------------------
For simplicity all the examples have been written for the simple example datasets that are provided with statismo (2D images of the hand). 
Example data  (Faces scans and Femur images) for building more interesting models can be downloaded directly from the projects website.
