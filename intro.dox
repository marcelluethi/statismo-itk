 * \section Introduction
 * Welcome to Statismo.
 *
 * Statismo is a C++ library for generating and manipulating Statistical
 * Shape and Image Models. It supports all commonly known types of
 * statistical models, including Shape models, Deformation Models and
 * Appearance Models. The implementation and interpretation is based on
 * Probabilistic PCA, which generalizes the standard PCA models and gives
 * a fully probabilistic interpretation.
