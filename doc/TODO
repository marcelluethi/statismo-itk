High Priority
-------------
- Implement functionality that lets the user specify the number of components 
  that are used when loading a model. 
- Common base class for vtk representer
- update documentation for representers
- Test the implementation with own use cases.
- Write a document that specifies the file format.
- Test installation for standalone vnl version. 
- Statistical model transform does not yet work for PointSets as the TransformPoint is only  valid for deformations. 
 - Implement represnter for itk pointset

Medium Priority
----------------
- Add Logging functionality to library
- The user should be able to choose between double and float precision in building models
- The HDF5 Utilities are written for a fixed type (float or double). We should make it dependent on the InternalMatrixType
- Wrappings may contain memory leaks

Low Priority
------------
