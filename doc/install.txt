Installation on Windows
-----------------------

Prerequisites:
- Download the latest source code from the svn. 
- Install vnl (Its tested with the vnl version coming with ITK 3.20, but any other version should do)
- Install vtk (tested with vtk 5.6, but any other reasonably recent version should do)
- Install hdf5 (tested with 1.8.7 but any other reasonably recent version should do)
IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a static and a shared version of HDF5. Make sure you install the shared one, as otherwise
you will get compiler errors. 

Compiling:
In the following CoMeSSM refers to the diretory of your CoMeSSM tree
1) Run CMake
2) Choose as a source directory CoMeSSM/src/Applications  (Don't choose the top directory, as it will also try to build the Python Wrappers)
3) Choose a build directory
4) Run configure
5) You will now be prompted to enter a few additional source Paths:
   - STATISTICAL_MODEL_DIR: choose CoMeSSM/src/StatisticalModel
   - VTK_DIR: The lib/vtk-5.x directory of your vtk installation
   - VNL_INCLUDE_DIR: The include dir of your vnl installation. If you use the vnl version that comes with ITK choose (ITK_INCLUDE_DIR/Utilities/vxl)
   - VNL_LIBRARY_DIR: The library dir of your vnl installation. If you use the vnl version that comes with ITK choose (ITK_LIB_DIR)
    - HDF_INCLUDE_DIR: The directory where your hdf5 headers reside
    - HDF_LIBRARY_DIR: The directory where your hdf5 libs are
6) Run configure
7) run generate
8) Open and build the generated project with Visual Studio
IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to build the RELEASE version of CoMeSSM, as the DEBUG version does not work with the HDF5 libraries.

Compiling with Python Support
The library can be used from Python, using automatically generated Swig Wrappers. To enable that, you will need to 
install SWIG on Windows and compile the project as above, but this time from the directory CoMeSSM/Wrapping.
More detailed instructions will follow. 

Running:
Once you've successfully built the project, you can try to run the example program.
Run: BasicUsage DataDir ResultDir
DataDir is the directory in the source tree that contains the example Data, e.g. CoMeSSM/data
ResultDir is an arbitrary output directory.
